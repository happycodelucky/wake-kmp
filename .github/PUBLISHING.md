# Publishing

Maintainer-facing runbook for cutting a Wake release. Aimed at the person
holding the publish keys; most contributors don't need this page.

Wake publishes two sibling Kotlin Multiplatform artifacts to Maven Central via
vanniktech's
[`gradle-maven-publish-plugin`](https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-maven-publish-plugin):

| Coordinate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `com.happycodelucky.wake:wake` | The library itself. |
| `com.happycodelucky.wake:wake-testing` | `FakeWake`, the recording `WakeSender`. Consumers wire as `testImplementation` / `commonTest`. |

Both ship together in every release run and version in lockstep: the release
workflow invokes `./gradlew publishAndReleaseToMavenCentral` without a module
scope, so every module declaring a `mavenPublishing { }` block is published.
Each artifact carries the Android AAR, KMP common metadata, the JVM jar,
per-target klibs (`iosArm64`, `iosSimulatorArm64`, `macosArm64`), and sources +
javadoc jars. Everything is GPG-signed in-process.

A real (non-dry-run) release additionally ships the Swift Package Manager
distribution via [KMMBridge](https://touchlab.co/kmmbridge/): the SKIE-enhanced
`WakeKit.xcframework` zip lands on the GitHub Release as a public asset, and the
root `Package.swift` is regenerated to reference it by URL + checksum. See
[SPM distribution](#spm-distribution) below for the mechanics and failure
recovery.

## Cutting a release

1. **Actions → Release → Run workflow.**
2. Pick `bumpType` — `patch` (default), `minor`, or `major`.
3. Optionally fill `versionSuffix` for a pre-release (`beta`, `preview`,
   `rc.1`, …). Leave blank for a final release.
4. Leave `dryRun` at its default (`true`) for the first run.
5. **Run workflow.**

The version is computed, not specified. The workflow reads the latest release
tag, applies the chosen bump (incrementing that component and zeroing everything
below it — standard semver), and appends the suffix if one was given. The runner
never types a version number.

If the latest release is `v0.3.7`:

| `bumpType` | `versionSuffix` | Computed version |
|---|---|---|
| `patch` | _(empty)_ | `0.3.8` |
| `minor` | _(empty)_ | `0.4.0` |
| `major` | _(empty)_ | `1.0.0` |
| `patch` | `beta` | `0.3.8-beta` |
| `patch` | `rc.1` | `0.3.8-rc.1` |
| `minor` | `preview` | `0.4.0-preview` |

The computed version appears in the **Release plan** section of the run summary
on the Actions UI before any irreversible step fires. If something looks wrong
(wrong bump type, mistyped suffix, unexpected base), cancel the run and start
over.

Because the version is fully deterministic from the latest release (no
run-number component), a dry run and the subsequent real publish compute the
**same** version. The `Verify version not already published` step and the
tag-exists guard are what catch an accidental repeat of an already-released
version.

### Version suffix rules

`versionSuffix` is appended after a dash to produce a SemVer pre-release version
(`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-SUFFIX`). The workflow validates the suffix against the
SemVer 2.0 grammar before any publish: dot-separated lowercase alphanumeric
segments, hyphens allowed inside a segment. Valid examples:

- `beta`, `preview`, `alpha`, `dev`
- `rc1`, `rc2`, `rc.1`, `rc.2`
- `alpha.2.fix`, `beta-1`

Invalid examples (workflow fails with a clear error before publish):

- `BETA`, `Beta` — uppercase not allowed.
- `-beta`, `.rc`, `rc.` — segments can't start or end with a separator.
- `beta_1`, `beta+sha` — only alphanumeric and hyphen allowed inside a segment.

Pre-release versions sort *before* their corresponding final release in SemVer:
`0.3.8-rc.1` is older than `0.3.8`. So when cutting the final release after one
or more release candidates, just leave `versionSuffix` blank — the same
`patch`/`minor`/`major` bump produces a clean final version.

When the suffix is also used in the previous release (`v0.3.8-rc.1` is the latest
tag), the workflow strips the suffix before computing the new base — i.e. a
`patch` bump on top of `v0.3.8-rc.1` produces `0.3.9`, not `0.3.8-rc.1.x`.

### Dry run, then real publish

The dry run uploads to the Central Portal staging area and stops, so the
artifact set can be reviewed at
<https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/deployments> before anything is
released to the public. Click **Publish** in the Portal to release, or **Drop**
to discard.

The "stops at staging" behaviour depends on `automaticRelease = false` in the
`mavenPublishing { }` block in the
[`wake.publish` convention plugin](https://github.com/happycodelucky/wake-kmp/blob/main/gradle/plugins/src/main/kotlin/wake.publish.gradle.kts).
If that flag is ever flipped to `true`, the dry run silently becomes a real
publish — vanniktech treats the post-upload "release" step as automatic. The
flag is load-bearing; do not change it without understanding the cascade.

Before either publish step fires, the workflow does a
`Verify version not already published` check against
[`maven-metadata.xml`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/happycodelucky/wake/wake/maven-metadata.xml).
A collision fails the run with a clear message instead of letting Sonatype
reject the upload with a confusing "staging failed" error.

Once the staged set looks right, re-run the workflow with `dryRun=false`. The
same version is recomputed; the version-collision guard ensures it isn't already
on Central before the irreversible publish.

After a real publish, the workflow runs the SPM pipeline (below), which creates
the `vX.Y.Z` tag and GitHub Release, attaches the XCFramework zip, commits the
regenerated `Package.swift` to `main`, and fills in auto-generated release notes.

Within ~30 min the release is searchable at
<https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.happycodelucky.wake/wake>. Maven
Central indexing into <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/> usually takes a few
minutes longer.

**Maven Central releases are permanent.** Sonatype never deletes published
artifacts. A bad version means cutting a fresh `patch` bump that supersedes it;
there is no rollback. Use a `-SNAPSHOT` version for any experimental upload —
vanniktech auto-routes snapshots to the Central Portal snapshots endpoint, which
is mutable. (Snapshots aren't generated by this workflow; they're a
`./gradlew publishToMavenCentral -Pversion=X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT` from a developer
machine.)

## SPM distribution

Only on `dryRun=false`. After the Maven Central publish succeeds, three workflow
steps ship the Swift package:

1. **`./gradlew :wake:kmmBridgePublish`** — builds the release
   `WakeKit.xcframework` (all three slices, SKIE-enhanced), zips it, creates the
   GitHub Release tagged `vX.Y.Z` (the tag initially points at the pre-release
   `main` HEAD), uploads `WakeKit.xcframework.zip` as an asset, and regenerates
   the root `Package.swift` with the asset URL + sha256 checksum. The task only
   exists when `-PENABLE_PUBLISHING=true` is passed, so local builds can't trip
   it.
2. **URL rewrite** — KMMBridge writes the GitHub *API* asset URL
   (`api.github.com/repos/…/releases/assets/<id>.zip`). SPM can consume it, but
   it serves JSON to plain HTTP clients and burns the anonymous
   60-requests/hour API quota. The workflow rewrites it to the public
   `releases/download/vX.Y.Z/WakeKit.xcframework.zip` URL — same bytes, same
   checksum — and validates the manifest with `swift package dump-package`.
3. **Commit + tag move** — the regenerated `Package.swift` is committed to
   `main`, and the `vX.Y.Z` tag is force-moved onto that commit so SPM consumers
   resolving the tag see the manifest that matches the uploaded binary. Release
   title + auto-generated notes are filled in last (KMMBridge creates the
   release bare).

The tag move is load-bearing: SPM reads `Package.swift` *from the tag*, then
downloads the binary it references. A tag without the regenerated manifest would
hand consumers a local-path (or stale) binary target.

### If the SPM steps fail mid-flight

Maven Central is already published at this point (irreversible), so don't re-run
the whole workflow — the version-collision guard will stop it. Recover manually
instead:

- **`kmmBridgePublish` failed before creating the release** — nothing SPM side
  happened. Run the remaining steps by hand from a `main` checkout, or tag the
  release manually (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z && gh release
  create vX.Y.Z --generate-notes`) and accept that this version has no Swift
  package.
- **Release exists but `Package.swift` wasn't committed / tag wasn't moved** —
  finish locally: update `Package.swift`'s `remoteKotlinUrl` /
  `remoteKotlinChecksum` (the checksum is `swift package compute-checksum
  WakeKit.xcframework.zip` on the downloaded asset), commit to `main`, then
  `git tag -fa vX.Y.Z && git push --force origin refs/tags/vX.Y.Z`.

## One-time setup

These steps were done once when Maven Central publishing was first wired up.
Re-doing any of them is only needed for key / credential rotation or if the
namespace is ever moved.

### 1. Claim the namespace

1. Log in to <https://central.sonatype.com>.
2. **View Namespaces** → **Add Namespace** → enter `com.happycodelucky`.
3. Copy the **Verification Key** Sonatype shows.
4. Add a DNS TXT record at the apex of `happycodelucky.com`:
    - Name: `@` (or leave blank, depending on the registrar's UI)
    - Value: the verification key, verbatim
5. Wait for DNS propagation, then click **Verify Namespace** in the Portal.

> The `com.happycodelucky` namespace is shared across this org's libraries
> (e.g. `reachable`), so it may already be verified — in which case skip this
> step.

### 2. Generate a Sonatype user token

The Central Portal login password is **not** what Gradle uploads with.

1. Portal → top-right avatar → **View Account** → **Generate User Token**.
2. Save both fields. Sonatype only shows the password once.
   - The username is short (~12 chars).
   - The password is longer (~24 chars).
3. These map to the `MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME` and `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD`
   GitHub secrets below.

### 3. Generate a GPG signing key

Central requires every artifact to be GPG-signed.

```bash
# 4096-bit RSA. Use a real email and a strong passphrase.
gpg --full-generate-key

# Grab the long key ID (16 hex chars after the rsa4096/ marker).
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

# Publish the public half so Central can verify signatures. Use hkps://
# (port 443 / HTTPS) — the legacy hkp:// port 11371 is firewalled on
# many networks. Belt-and-braces: push to all three.
gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys <LONG_KEY_ID>
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org    --send-keys <LONG_KEY_ID>
gpg --keyserver hkps://pgp.mit.edu         --send-keys <LONG_KEY_ID>

# Export the SECRET key. This is the blob that goes into the GitHub
# secret. Delete the .asc file from disk once stored in GitHub.
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <LONG_KEY_ID> > wake-signing.asc
```

After upload, confirm the key is findable by fingerprint:

```bash
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys <LONG_KEY_ID>
```

Or in a browser: <https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=YOUR_KEY_ID> — this is the
same lookup Sonatype performs at upload time.

**Quirk:** `keys.openpgp.org` strips the email address from uploaded keys until
you confirm via a verification link sent to that email. The cryptographic
material is uploaded regardless, so signature verification works fine — but the
key won't show up in email searches until you click the link.
`keyserver.ubuntu.com` and `pgp.mit.edu` don't strip emails.

> If you already generated a signing key for another `com.happycodelucky`
> library, reuse it — the same key signs every artifact under the namespace.

### 4. Configure GitHub Actions secrets

The release job runs in the `continuous-deployment` GitHub **environment**, so
the four secrets must be added there (Repo → **Settings** → **Environments** →
**continuous-deployment** → **Add secret**), not at the repository scope:

| Secret name                          | Value                                              |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME`             | Sonatype user token username (from step 2)         |
| `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD`             | Sonatype user token password (from step 2)         |
| `MAVEN_CENTRAL_SIGNING_KEY`          | Full contents of `wake-signing.asc` (from step 3)  |
| `MAVEN_CENTRAL_SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD` | The GPG key passphrase (from step 3)               |

`MAVEN_CENTRAL_SIGNING_KEY` must be the entire ASCII-armoured block, including
the `-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----` and `-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY
BLOCK-----` lines. Paste it verbatim — GitHub's secret editor preserves
newlines.

The key ID itself doesn't need to be stored — the in-memory key blob carries it.

## Local dry-run

Before cutting a release, you can sanity-check the publication shape without
uploading anything to Central:

```bash
# Builds, signs (if signing creds are present locally), and writes
# everything to ~/.m2/repository/com/happycodelucky/wake/.
./gradlew :wake:publishToMavenLocal -Pversion=0.0.1-test

# Inspect what got produced.
ls -lh ~/.m2/repository/com/happycodelucky/wake/wake/0.0.1-test/
```

Expect to see: `.aar`, `-sources.jar`, `-javadoc.jar`, `.module`, `.pom`, and
`.asc` next to each.

**vanniktech 0.36.0 fails the build if signing creds are missing.** That's
intentional — it stops you accidentally publishing an unsigned artifact to
Central, which the Portal would reject anyway. To dry-run locally you have two
choices:

1. **Inspect generated POMs only** (no signing required): run any of the
   `generatePomFileFor*Publication` tasks, then read
   `wake/build/publications/<publication>/pom-default.xml`.
2. **Full local publish with signing**: export the signing env vars before
   running Gradle.

```bash
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingInMemoryKey="$(cat ~/path/to/wake-signing.asc)"
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingInMemoryKeyPassword="<passphrase>"
./gradlew :wake:publishToMavenLocal -Pversion=0.0.1-test
```

`publishToMavenLocal` never contacts Central or GitHub — it only writes to your
local `~/.m2`, so it's safe to run any time.

## Rotating credentials

### Sonatype user token

If the token leaks or you want a fresh one, generate a new one in the Portal
(Step 2 above), then update `MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME` and `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD`
in the environment secrets. The old token continues to work until you revoke it
from the Portal.

### GPG signing key

If the signing key leaks: generate a new key (Step 3 above), upload its public
half, then update `MAVEN_CENTRAL_SIGNING_KEY` and
`MAVEN_CENTRAL_SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD` in the environment secrets. Past releases
signed with the old key remain valid — keyservers retain the public half
forever, so Central can still verify their signatures. Future releases will be
signed with the new key.

You can also publish a revocation certificate for the old key if you generated
one with `gpg --gen-revoke` — that's a stronger signal than just leaving the key
dormant.
